// COMMENT: The overall usage of this command line client is clumsy while being
// able to slowly discover all the things needed to render the final command, I
// found myself constantly going back to the begining of the line and editing
// the subcommand. In truth the command should flow, where as you offer it more data,
// the context of what it shows you changes. The issue with doing this currently is the
// filter argument at the end of each subcommand. This should be changed to a flag instead
// so the flow can function. It could be made as a persistent flag since each subcommand uses it
// I felt it was good to leave out a directions sub command as the directions are so closely
// married to a route. The only reason it wasn't a default action is because it does demand a
// new request to the api for each item

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
